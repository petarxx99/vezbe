The main function is in the main.c file. 
Dog inherits from Animal.
Dog and Car implement interface CanMakeNoise.
This is a demo project to show how to implement some OOP features in C.
Using this method it is relatively easy to make "classes" that implement several interfaces and that can inherit 1 other class (essentially, copying what it can be done in Java).
I haven't yet find an elegant method to implement multiple inheritance in C.
